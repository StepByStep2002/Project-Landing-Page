# Project-Landing-Page

In this project i was given a task to create a whole page from zero by referring to the 2 images: one is showing a completed design of the page, and the other shows fonts and colors that were used.

During this project i've used flexbox tools and techniques that helped me with aligning all content properly, i've improved my skills of using flexbox and CSS.

Currently this project only made with normal PC screens in mind, it is not yet configured to adjust to different resolutions or zoom levels.
